    <h1>Sunday Psalms</h1>
    <h2>Written by Thomas R. Adams</h2>
    <pre>Verse 1

Cigarettes and coffee on a Sunday mornin’, walkin’ down to church,
Lettin’ go of all the noise that built up and made my chest hurt.
But with the early choir’s hummin’, windows glowin’ soft and warm,
I finally find a moment where I can breathe again.

Verse 2

I’ve been tryin’ to come clean about the things I’ve done wrong,
I’ve pushed good friends away so many times I’ve lost count, you know.
These days I’m learnin’ slow, takin’ it step by step,
Tryin’ hard to find my footing on the path I once left.

Chorus

Oh, it’s somethin’ about those Sunday psalms
They bring us together and help us along.
Oh, those sweet Sunday melodies stringin’ us along
In happiness and peace.
And I just want to live and love
Oh, it’s somethin’ about those Sunday psalms.

Verse 3

Better arrive to the chapel early if you wanna catch a pew,
Whole town will fill it up and the preacher don’t wait for no queue.
And when the choir starts singin’, every heartbeat falls in line,
Liftin’ all our worn-out burdens as if God is standin’ by.

Chorus

Oh, it’s somethin’ about those Sunday psalms
They bring us together and help us along.
Oh, those sweet Sunday melodies stringin’ us along
In happiness and peace.
And I just want to live and love
Oh, it’s somethin’ about those Sunday psalms.

Chorus

Oh, it’s somethin’ about those Sunday psalms
They bring us together and help us along.
Oh, those sweet Sunday melodies stringin’ us along
In happiness and peace.
And I just want to live and love
Oh, it’s somethin’ about those Sunday psalms.</pre>
