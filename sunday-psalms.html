  <h1>Sunday Psalms</h1>
  <h2>Heartland, faith-tinged country</h2>
  <pre>
Verse 1:
Cigarettes and coffee on a Sunday morning
Walk down to the church, gettin’ ready to speak to God
Yeah, He’s in everything that George Strait rehearsed
And if you don’t look, then darlin’, you won’t see
How ashamed we ought to be
Buried in our phones

Verse 2:
And I’ve tried to come clean about all the things that I’ve done wrong
I’ve pushed everyone away so many times I’ve lost count, you know
But now that you’re in my life I’ve hopped back on track
And I’m ridin’ through a heaven-sent sky

Chorus:
Oh, it’s somethin’ about those Sunday psalms
They bring us together and help us along
Oh, those sweet Sunday melodies
Stringin’ us along in happiness and peace
And I just wanna live and love
Oh, it’s somethin’ about those Sunday psalms

Verse 3:
Better arrive to the chapel early if you wanna catch a pew
The whole town will fill it up and the preacher don’t wait for no cue
They start and end when the choir sings
And leave us all to imagine the worst in everything

(Chorus)
Oh, it’s somethin’ about those Sunday psalms
They bring us together and help us along
Oh, those sweet Sunday melodies
Stringin’ us along in happiness and peace
And I just wanna live and love
Oh, it’s somethin’ about those Sunday psalms

Bridge:
Well, it’s just another Sunday afternoon
Time to be thankful and rejoice all news
It’s a family dinner and a prayer
The smell of Dad’s sweet tea fills the air
And a classic country song on the radio
(Slow) Oh, it’s somethin’ about those Sunday psalms

Final Choruses:
Oh, it’s somethin’ about those Sunday psalms
They bring us together and help us along
Oh, those sweet Sunday melodies
Stringin’ us along in happiness and peace
And I just wanna live and love
Oh, it’s somethin’ about those Sunday psalms
