[Verse 1]
Your hopefulness in every lie
When crossing your T’s and dotting your I’s.
Your open emotion that you try to hide
Only works if you’re blind.

[Verse 2]
Your secrets kept behind a cheap disguise,
A smoke screen of memories that died.
Time to bury all that’s left,
And move along your feelings of regret.

[Pre-Chorus]
You only got so much of the rope you’re hangin’ on,
So hold on tight and don’t let your grip
All come undone.

[Chorus]
You don’t got so long
To carry on—
It ain’t worth wastin’ time.
Better pack your shit
And move out quick
With each minute passin’ you by.

[Instrumental / Hum]
(Humming over progression)

[Pre-Chorus]
You only got so much of the rope you’re hangin’ on,
So hold on tight and don’t let your grip
All come undone.

[Outro]
You don’t got so long
To carry on,
And it ain’t worth wasting your time.
