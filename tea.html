    <h1>Tea</h1>
    <h2>Written by Thomas R. Adams</h2>
    <pre>Verse 1

Can you be my cup of tea,
And me your glass of wine
Wet windshields on rainy days
Dull these tired eyes.
But your hand upon my back
Always wakes me up just fine 
Time to see if we can swim
As we sink into our lives.

Chorus

Honey baby (echo: honey baby) please believe me (echo: please believe me)
No, you can’t do no wrong.
Glide around our living room,
Dancing to our song.
Honey baby, please believe me 
No, you can’t do no wrong.
Dressin’ up or dressin’ down,
You’re in each line of my songs.

Verse 2

I want you to be my sweet piece of taffy,
And me your gumdrop.
Oh, let me be the river,
And you be the flop.

Chorus

Honey baby (echo: honey baby) please believe me (echo: please believe me)
No, you can’t do no wrong.
Glide around our living room,
Dancing to our song.
Honey baby, please believe me 
No, you can’t do no wrong.
Dressin’ up or dressin’ down,
You’re in each line of my songs.

Bridge

I get tangled up in my own habits,
Thinking too much about things long gone.
But your voice cuts through the noise every time,
And it feels like coming home.

Final Chorus

Honey baby (echo: honey baby) please believe me (echo: please believe me)
No, you can’t do no wrong.
Glide around our living room,
Dancing to our song.
Honey baby, please believe me 
No, you can’t do no wrong.
Dressin’ up or dressin’ down,
You’re in each line of my songs.</pre>
