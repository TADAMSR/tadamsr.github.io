[Verse 1]
Can you be my cup of tea,
And me your glass of wine?
Wet windshields on rainy days
Dull these tired eyes.
But your hand pressed gentle on my back wakes me up just fine—
Time to see if we still float as we sink into our lives.

[Chorus]
Honey baby (honey baby), please believe me (please believe me),
You can’t do no wrong.
Glide around our livin’ room,
Dancin’ to our song.
Honey baby (honey baby), please believe me (please believe me),
No, you can’t do no wrong.
Dressin’ up or dressin’ down,
You’re in each line of my songs.

[Verse 2]
I want you to be my sweet piece of taffy,
And me your gumdrop.
Oh, let me be the river,
And you be the flop.
Let the cards fall easy while you lay across my chest—
Every shuffle, every breath, yeah, baby, we’re a perfect bet.

[Bridge / Verse 3]
Me without you is like the sun without the moon,
I tend to bite unless you’re there to lend a hand.
I dwell on the past and that ain’t good, but you pull me through,
You’re a serotonin pick-me-up the way my smokes used to do.

[Final Chorus]
Honey baby (honey baby), please believe me (please believe me),
You can’t do no wrong.
Glide around our livin’ room,
Dancin’ to our song.
Honey baby (honey baby), please believe me (please believe me),
No, you can’t do no wrong.
Dressin’ up or dressin’ down,
You’re in each line of my songs.
