    <h1>Stale Cigarettes</h1>
    <h2>Written by Thomas R. Adams</h2>
    <pre>Verse 1 — Slow, dusty intro

The early mist of the mornin’
Where the cold wind cuts your breath,
Finds me hidin’ in the mesquite shade
With a past I ain’t confessed.
I’ve been driftin’ down these back-road trails,
Half broke, half hell-bent —
Just a rider with his shadow,
One he still hasn’t met.

Verse 2 — Building tempo

Tracks behind me embed the red clay,
Ain’t the kind that fade away;
Been outrunnin’ every promise
That I broke along the way.
And I ain’t beggin’ for forgiveness —
That my master won’t accept —
But the wind keeps hummin’ stories
That I’ll take till my last breath.

Chorus — Full gallop

Rain-soaked butts in my pocket,
From a pack some weeks ago,
Said it’s my last one only a hundred times before.
I’ve been ridin’, runnin’, restless —
Leavin’ every town I get —
Burnin’ up my lungs before the sunrise
On stale cigarettes.

Verse 3 — Wide-open western imagery

There’s a mountain view in Texas
Where the desert meets the sky,
And the ghosts that ride beside me
Ain’t the kind that ever die.
So I tip my hat to daylight,
Let my sins fall where they land —
I’m just a borrowed man.

Chorus

Rain-soaked butts in my pocket,
From a pack some weeks ago,
Said it’s my last one only a hundred times before.
I’ve been ridin’, runnin’, restless —
Leavin’ every town I get —
Burnin’ up my lungs before the sunrise
On stale cigarettes.

Bridge

Maybe someday I’ll stop movin’,
Find a place to lay my head;
But a man don’t claim his freedom
When he’s runnin’ from the dead.

Final Chorus 

Rain-soaked butts in my pocket,
From a pack some weeks ago,
Said it’s my last one only a hundred times before.
I’ve been ridin’, runnin’, reckless —
Ain’t outrun my demons yet —
But I keep breathin’ through the sunrise
With stale cigarettes.</pre>
