[Chorus]
I’d be a fool to ever say I loved her,
And I’d be a liar to say that she’d be coming home.
All that time I said I cared when she knew I didn’t,
Oh, I’d be a fool and I’d be a liar to think she’d believe.

[Verse 1]
We were good before the winter months passed us by,
But the cold pushed our cuddles of warmth aside.
In dreams we’d bicker and argue, waking up to empty promises—
That’s when I knew our well had run dry.

[Chorus]
I’d be a fool to ever say I loved her,
And I’d be a liar to say that she’d be coming home.
All that time I said I cared when she knew I didn’t,
Oh, I’d be a fool and liar to think she’d believe.

[Verse 2]
Oh, the glances she’d give and the emotions we hid,
We tried like hell for quite some time.
But it never seemed to go the way we wanted,
And we are all out of last goodbyes.

[Chorus]
I’d be a fool to ever say I loved her,
And I’d be a liar to say that she’d be coming home.
All that time I said I cared when she knew I didn’t,
Oh, I’d be a fool and liar to think she’d believe.

[Outro]
I’d be a fool and liar to think she’d believe.
