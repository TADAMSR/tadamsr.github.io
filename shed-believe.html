    <h1>She’d Believe</h1>
    <h2>Written by Thomas R. Adams</h2>
    <pre>Chorus

I’d be a fool to ever say I loved her,
And I’d be a liar to say that she’d be coming home.
All that time I said I cared when she knew I didn’t—
Oh, I’d be a fool and a liar to think she’d believe.

Verse 1

We were good before the winter months passed us by,
But the cold pushed our cuddles of warmth aside.
In dreams, we’d bicker and argue, waking up to empty promises—
That’s when I knew our well had run dry.

Chorus

I’d be a fool to ever say I loved her,
And I’d be a liar to say that she’d be coming home.
All that time I said I cared when she knew I didn’t—
Oh, I’d be a fool and a liar to think she’d believe.

Verse 2

Oh, the glances she’d give,
And the emotions we hid.
We tried like hell for quite some time,
But it never went the way we wanted—
And now we’re all out of last goodbyes.

Chorus

I’d be a fool to ever say I loved her,
And I’d be a liar to say that she’d be coming home.
All that time I said I cared when she knew I didn’t—
Oh, I’d be a fool and a liar to think she’d believe.

Outro

Oh, I’d be a fool and a liar to think she’d believe.</pre>
