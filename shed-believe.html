  <h1>She’d Believe</h1>
  <h2>Heartbreak ballad — modern country</h2>
  <pre>
Chorus:
I’d be a fool to ever say I loved her
And I’d be a liar to say that she’d be coming home
All that time I said I cared when she knew I didn’t
Oh, I’d be a fool and I’d be a liar to think she’d believe

Verse:
We were good before the winter months passed us by
But the heat ran our cuddles of warmth aside
Through dreams we’d bicker and argue over empty promises
That’s when I knew our well had run dry

(Chorus)
I’d be a fool to ever say I loved her
And I’d be a liar to say that she’d be coming home
All that time I said I cared when she knew I didn’t
Oh, I’d be a fool and liar to think she’d believe

Verse:
Oh, the glances she’d give
And the emotions we hid
We tried like hell for quite some time
But it never seemed to go the way we wanted
And we are all out of last goodbyes

Final Chorus:
I’d be a fool to ever say I loved her
And I’d be a liar to say that she’d be coming home
All that time I said I cared when she knew I didn’t
Oh, I’d be a fool and liar to think she’d believe

Tag:
Oh, I’d be a fool and liar to think she’d believe
