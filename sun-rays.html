[Chorus]
I see you in the sun rays,
My better half of my better days.
The smell of your perfume in the springtime,
Your fuzzy image penetrates my mind.

[Verse 1]
Drink in the moonlight like a Zinfandel,
A candy-coated dream I inhale.
Your sweet concoction of love,
The rush I get when our lips touch.

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, the silent days and silent nights,
Memories of us skatin’ through life.
I wrestle these thoughts, and oh, I realize
That without you I’m lost.

[Chorus]
But I still see you in the sun rays,
My better half of my better days.
Smile shine glaring off the ice in the wintertime,
Your words a poem that inscript my mind,
Sayin’:
Oh, I love you, my darlin’,
Oh, my darlin’, my love.
Whisper sweet love to me, darlin’ (oh yeah),
You hold my heart in your arms (yeah).

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2 – Outro]
And when the night fades into golden haze,
I feel your touch still callin’ my name.
Your silhouette soft in the evening light,
Goosebumps waltz down my spine.

And all through these changin’ seasons,
I’m holdin’ tight to every lovin’ reason.
Oh darlin’, even when the daylight’s gone,
I close my eyes and still see you in the sun rays.
