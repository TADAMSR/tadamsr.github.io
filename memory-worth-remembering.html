  <h1>Memory Worth Remembering</h1>
  <h2>Nostalgic, emotional country / Americana</h2>
  <pre>
Chorus:
I wanna be a postcard you send home to Mama
When you get to a place you’ve never been before
I wanna be a picture in the scrapbook
One with a story never told before
I don’t mind being dusted off if stowed away
As long as I get opened up sometime

Pre-Chorus:
I don’t need to be a prayer that’s given
When you speak to God at night
Or in a dream you have when you’re missin’ me in life
I don’t need to be a passed-down heirloom
That’s cherished with love
But a memory worth remembering is what I’m thinkin’ of

Verse / Chorus 2:
I wanna be a VHS
The kind you watch to harness
All the love from old memories
I wanna be a tool set
The one Dad handed down
I may not be useful, but you’ll always keep me around

Pre-Chorus:
I don’t need to be a prayer that’s given
When you speak to God at night
Or in a dream you have when you’re missin’ me in life
I don’t need to be a passed-down heirloom
That’s cherished with love
But a memory worth remembering is what I’m thinkin’ of
