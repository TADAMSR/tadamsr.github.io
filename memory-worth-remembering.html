    <h1>Memory Worth Remembering</h1>
    <h2>Written by Thomas R. Adams</h2>
    <pre>Chorus

I wanna be a postcard you send home to mama,
From a little town you’ve never been before.
I wanna be a picture tucked in a scrapbook,
One with a story you’ve never told before.
And I don’t mind bein’ dusted off if I’m stowed away,
As long as I get opened up sometime.

Verse 1

I ain’t askin’ to be some treasure on your mantel,
Or somethin’ sacred that you guard with your whole heart.
Just a small reminder folded in your pocket,
Proof that even little moments can leave a mark.

Pre-Chorus

I don’t need to be a prayer you whisper when you hit your knees at night,
Or some dream you chase when the nightmares get too rough.
I don’t need to be an heirloom passed down through the years—
Just somethin’ worth recallin’ when the quiet draws you near.

Chorus

I wanna be a postcard you send home to mama,
From a little town you’ve never been before.
I wanna be a picture tucked in a scrapbook,
One with a story you’ve never told before.
And I don’t mind bein’ dusted off if I’m stowed away,
As long as I get opened up sometime.

Verse 2

Maybe I’m that old vinyl you keep for the memories,
The kind that crackles when the melody comes through.
Or a worn-down pocketknife your daddy handed over,
Ain’t much to look at, but it still holds up—same as when he handed it to you.

Pre-Chorus

I don’t need to be a prayer you whisper when you hit your knees at night,
Or some dream you chase when the nightmares get too rough.
I don’t need to be an heirloom passed down through the years—
Just somethin’ worth recallin’ when the quiet draws you near.

Chorus

I wanna be a postcard you send home to mama,
From a little town you’ve never been before.
I wanna be a picture tucked in a scrapbook,
One with a story you’ve never told before.
And I don’t mind bein’ dusted off if I’m stowed away,
As long as I get opened up sometime.</pre>
