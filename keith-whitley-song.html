[Verse 1]
I need a sad song,
Or maybe a Marty Robbins ballad all night long.
Play me some Junior Sisk
To help these brand-new boots of mine break in and fit.
I ain’t gonna ask twice,
Don’t need advice—
Just spin another Bob Dylan hit.

[Chorus]
My wheels keep rollin’ past the county lines,
Chasin’ down the quiet where the neon dies.
I’m hopin’ trains like a Jerry Jeff song,
Singin’ “Hello Walls” with Willie and Faron Young.
When the silence cuts deeper than the whiskey stings,
And all these barroom halos lose their shine by spring,
If there’s one thing I still chase when the night gets long,
Lord, I need a Keith Whitley song.

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I’m no stranger to the rain, you know,
Darlin’, don’t close your eyes, just let it go.
I just wanna see you smilin’ down in Miami now.
But when you say nothin’ at all,
It makes this hard heart feel so small,
’Cause it was love from only ten feet away somehow.

[Chorus]
My wheels keep rollin’ past the county lines,
Chasin’ down the quiet where the neon dies.
I’m hopin’ trains like a Jerry Jeff song,
Singin’ “Hello Walls” with Willie and Faron Young.
When the silence cuts deeper than the whiskey stings,
And all these barroom halos lose their shine by spring,
If there’s one thing I still chase when the night gets long,
Lord, I need a Keith Whitley song.

[Bridge]
When the quiet hits too strong, my wishful thinkin’ proves me wrong,
And I hear angels hummin’ “Unchained Melody.”
Every line cuts like a knife, every word feels like my life,
And it sounds like Keith is still singin’ just for me.

[Final Chorus]
My wheels keep rollin’ past the county lines,
Chasin’ down the quiet where the neon dies.
I’m hopin’ trains like a Jerry Jeff song,
Singin’ “Hello Walls” with Willie and Faron Young.
When the silence cuts deeper than the whiskey stings,
And all these barroom halos lose their shine by spring,
If there’s one thing I still chase when the night gets long,
Lord, I need a Keith Whitley song.
Yeah, if there’s one thing I still chase when the night gets long,
I just need a Keith Whitley song.
