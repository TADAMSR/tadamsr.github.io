  <h1>I Need a Keith Whitley Song</h1>
  <h2>Traditional country, full of classic references</h2>
  <pre>
I need a sad song
Or maybe Marty Robbins ballad all night long
Play me some Junior Sisk
To help me with these brand-new shoes of mine to fit
I ain’t gonna ask twice
No need for advice
Play another Bob Dylan hit

Chorus:
Yeah my tracks are running long
I’m hoppin’ trains like a Jerry Jeff song
Sayin’ “Hello Walls” from Willie and Faron Young
I got no more stress of mind
No more pain to idealize
I hear them angels hum an “Unchained Melody”
But if there’s one thing I need
That’ll keep me good and clean
It’s a damn old Keith Whitley song
I need a Keith Whitley song

Verse:
Yeah I’m no stranger to the rain
Darlin’, don’t close your eyes again
I just wish to see you happy in Miami now
But when you say nothing at all
It makes my heartbeat feel so small
‘Cause it was love from only ten feet away

(Chorus)
Yeah my tracks are running long
I’m hoppin’ trains like a Jerry Jeff song
Sayin’ “Hello Walls” from Willie and Faron Young
I got no more stress of mind
No more pain to idealize
I hear them angels hum an “Unchained Melody”
But if there’s one thing I need
That’ll keep me good and clean
It’s a damn old Keith Whitley song
I need a Keith Whitley song

End:
Yeah my tracks are running long
I’m hoppin’ trains like a Jerry Jeff song
Sayin’ “Hello Walls” from Willie and Faron Young
I got no more stress of mind
No more pain to idealize
Just a damn old Keith Whitley song
I’d love a Keith Whitley song
