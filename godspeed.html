    <h1>GodSpeed</h1>
    <h2>Written by Thomas R. Adams</h2>
    <pre>Verse 1

The devil caught me in West Virginia
While I was chasin’ demons down.
I found a pair of wings in a suitcase,
Hit the road and never turned around.

Verse 2

There’s a hymn that keeps on whisperin’,
Enough to make your hair stand up.
They’re trackin’ every step I’m takin’
I just pray they don’t catch up.

Chorus

Now I fly at Godspeed,
Ain’t ever comin’ down.
I’m running off these wings and a prayer
The devil knows he can’t catch me now.

Verse 3

As far as these borrowed wings will take me
Is as far as I may go.
The devil’s slowly losin’ sight of me,
And I’ll get caught if I don’t skip town tonight.

Chorus

Now I fly at Godspeed,
Ain’t ever comin’ down.
I’m running off these wings and a prayer 
The devil knows he can’t catch me now.
’Cause I’m travelin’ at Godspeed now.

Final Chorus

So I fly at Godspeed,
Won’t ever touch down.
I’m fueled by borrowed wings and a prayer
The devil knows he won’t catch me now.
’Cause I’m movin’ at Godspeed now.</pre>
