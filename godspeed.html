[Verse 1]
The devil caught me in West Virginia
While I was chasin’ demons down.
I found some wings in a suitcase,
Hit the road and never turned ’round.
Ran from every shadow, every echo of my past,
Prayin’ that these borrowed wings would finally hold fast.

[Verse 2]
There’s a hymn a-whisperin’,
Enough to make your hair stand up.
They’re trackin’ my footsteps,
Lord, I hope they don’t catch up.
I’ve been runnin’ from the fire and the man I used to be,
Beggin’ for a little grace to finally set me free.

[Chorus]
Now I fly at Godspeed,
Ain’t never comin’ down.
I’m runnin’ off these wings and a prayer,
The devil knows he can’t catch me now.
As long as I keep movin’ on this narrow, windin’ ground,
I’ll be flyin’ at Godspeed, never comin’ down.

[Verse 3]
Just as far as these wings will take me
Is as far as I may go.
The devil’s losin’ his sight line,
But I’ll get caught if I don’t roll.
So I keep my eyes on heaven, leave my past in the dust,
Hold tight to these feathers stitched with mercy and with trust.

[Chorus]
Now I fly at Godspeed,
Ain’t never comin’ down.
I’m runnin’ off these wings and a prayer,
The devil knows he can’t catch me now.
As long as I keep movin’ on this narrow, windin’ ground,
I’ll be flyin’ at Godspeed, never comin’ down.

[Outro]
So I fly at Godspeed,
Won’t ever touch down.
I’m fueled off these wings and a prayer,
The devil knows he won’t catch me now.
I’m travelin’ at Godspeed now.
