[Verse 1]
Monday mornin’s get the best of me,
Tuesday takes whatever’s left.
By Wednesday my body’s sittin’ on empty,
And the rest of the week runs on regret.

[Verse 2]
Then Sunday comes to place its bets,
By the mornin’ the cycle starts again.
Same old worry, same old wear,
Till you walked in and changed all that.

[Verse 3]
On the holidays I try to be
The best damn human God’s ever seen,
Until you came, like the angel I need—
Now I’m more than who I used to be.

[Chorus]
And I never thought I’d ever make it here,
So I guess I’ll have to play it ear by ear,
Until a plan unfolds or it all dissolves.
And I can’t
