  <h1>Your Man</h1>
  <h2>Earned-love country ballad</h2>
  <pre>
Monday mornings get the best of me
Tuesday takes what’s left
By Wednesday my body’s sittin’ on empty

And the rest of the week is filled with regret
Till Sunday comes to place its bets
By the morning the cycle starts again

On the holidays I try to be
The best damn human God has seen
Till you came and changed all that

Chorus:
And I never thought I’d ever make it here
So I guess I’ll have to play it ear by ear
Until a plan unfolds or it all gets dissolved
And I can’t tell you the last time I
Ever felt like one of those guys
The ones who had it all in the palm of their hands
Until I became your man

On the weekends I try to impress
That image I picture in my head
And in the mirror I see it all again

Then that alarm clock rings and I wake up
A bad dream I had of someone else’s trust
I thought I’d lost that, but it must be my mind

(Chorus)
And I never thought I’d ever make it here
So I guess I’ll have to play it ear by ear
Until a plan unfolds or it all gets dissolved
And I can’t tell you the last time I
Ever felt like one of those guys
The ones who had it all in the palm of their hands
Until I became your man

Verse:
And I remember sittin’ in a lazy chair
Starin’ at dusty fan blades rotating through air
Another fever dream that I can’t recall

Outro:
And I never thought I’d ever be standing here
Your permeating eyes with diamond glare
While I buckle at the knees — please forgive me
And I can’t tell you the last time I
Ever felt like one of those guys
The ones who had it all in the palm of their hands
Until I became your man
Yes ma’am
