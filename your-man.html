    <h1>Your Man</h1>
    <h2>Written by Thomas R. Adams</h2>
    <pre>Verse 1

Monday mornings get the best of me,
Tuesday takes whatever’s left.
By Wednesday my whole body’s sittin’ empty

Verse 2

And the rest of the week runs on regret,
Till Sunday comes to place its bets.
By sunrise, the cycle starts again,

Verse 3

On the holidays I try to be
The best damn human God’s ever seen,
Until you came, like the angel I need.

Chorus

And I never thought I’d ever make it here,
So I guess I’ll have to play it ear by ear
Until a plan unfolds or it all dissolves.

And I can’t tell you the last time I
Ever felt like one of those guys,
The ones who held the world
Right in the palm of their hands

Until I became your man.

Verse 4

On the weekends I still try to impress
That picture-perfect version in my head.
And every time I look into the mirror,
It stares right back instead.

Verse 5

Then that alarm clock rings and I wake up
From a bad dream born of someone else’s trust.
I thought I lost that, but must’ve been my mind

Chorus

And I never thought I’d ever make it here,
So I guess I’ll have to play it ear by ear
Until a plan unfolds or it all dissolves.

And I can’t tell you the last time I
Ever felt like one of those guys,
The ones who held the world
Right in the palm of their hands

Until I became your man.

Verse 6

I remember sitting in a lazy chair,
Watching dusty fan blades rotate through air. Another nightmare without

Final Chorus / Outro

And I never thought I’d ever be standing here,
Your shimmering eyes like a diamond glare
While I buckle at the knees 
Honey, please forgive me.

‘Cause I can’t tell you the last time I
Ever felt like one of those guys,
The ones who held the world
Right in the palm of their hands

Until I became your man.
Yes ma’am.</pre>
